Description
----------------
This web app will display multiple TwitchTV streams in an easy to use keyboard enabled interface. This aims to solve the problem of watching multiple TwitchTV streams during an eSports tournament. Itâ€™s a hassle to watch multiple streams because muting when switching between streams is not automatic, and there are no hotkeys to control the stream settings.
