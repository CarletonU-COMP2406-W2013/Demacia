## Application Description
Our web application “DemaciaTV” is a multi-stream browser for TwitchTV. DemaciaTV adds keyboard hotkey functionality for fast stream manipulations (fullscreen modes, mute, hide/show chat/stream browser) which makes viewing multiple streams easy and seamless. The user can browse the different streams by navigating the left sidebar and drag a specific stream to a specific stream container. Alternatively, the user can click on the stream which automatically adds it to the currently focused stream container (containers 1-4).

*On a side note, one can view the statistics of each account logged into the application by going directly to the /db-manager page. Although this functionality is not meant for users, it is still interesting to see the different statistics for each account that the application keeps track of. Future implementation will be that the user can only view his statistics by clicking on his name when logged in.
